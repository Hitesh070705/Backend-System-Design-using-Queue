# Backend System Design Using Queue

## Overview
This project implements a robust and scalable backend system that manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected to the system has its own queue where all requests are processed sequentially. The system uses Node.js for the server, Redis for queue management, MongoDB for data storage, and Prometheus with Grafana for monitoring.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users before they can enqueue requests.
- **Request Queueing**: Implement a FIFO queue for each client to handle requests.
- **Request Processing**: Execute requests sequentially using worker processes.
- **Concurrency Management**: Handle multiple clients and queues concurrently.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently scale to manage increasing numbers of users and requests.
- **Robustness**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Track request handling and monitor performance metrics.

## Architecture
The system follows a client-server model with the following key components:
- **Client Interface**: Users interact with the system and send requests to the server.
- **Server**: Receives requests, authenticates users, and enqueues requests.
- **Queue Management**: Each client has a dedicated queue in Redis.
- **Worker Processes**: Process tasks from queues sequentially.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
